This web app fetches data from https://www.themoviedb.org. <br>
It was built using React and styled components <br>
I also added session storage inside the useEffect of the custom hooks that fetch the data so it optimizes speed and data transfer <br>
I am working on an authorization and user login system to rate movies and save them in favourites
